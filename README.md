# 2048-AI
An AI that plays the game 2048 using the expectimax and minimax algorithms.

You'll need pygame to run the GUI.

**Files**:
**GUI_TestRun.py** You can play 2048 just to test the environment
**minimax.py** implements the minimax logic with maxDepth set as 4 
**expectimax.py** implements the minimax logic with maxDepth set as 5
**moves.py** implements the logic for moves(controlled with arrow keys)

You'll find the heursitic functions in the score() functions in minimax.py and expectimax.py


**Results**: 
The maximum tile the AI has created is 1024. Further updates on the heuristic functions will increase this value.
